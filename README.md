The playbook provides a structured response to a phishing incident by guiding SOC analysts through a series of systematic steps. 
Upon receiving the alert, the playbook outlines how to evaluate the severity and details of the email, including sender information, message anomalies, 
and the presence of attachments or links. Analysts use threat intelligence tools to verify malicious file hashes or URLs, confirming their harmful nature.

Once malicious activity is identified, the playbook directs analysts to update the ticket with findings, escalate it to higher-level analysts for further action,
and implement protective measures. It ensures documentation of all findings and actions taken, enabling efficient incident resolution and minimizing organizational 
risk. Finally, the playbook facilitates the proper closure of the alert, emphasizing lessons learned and reinforcing user awareness training to prevent future incidents.
